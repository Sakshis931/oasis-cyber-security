# Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid growth of digital transformation, cloud computing, and internet-based services, network security has become a critical concern for organizations and individuals. Network security threats exploit vulnerabilities in networks to disrupt services, steal data, or gain unauthorized access. This report focuses on three major and commonly occurring network security threats:

- Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks  
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks  
- Spoofing Attacks  

The report explains how each threat works, its impact, real-world examples, and effective preventive measures.

## 2. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

### 2.1 What is a DoS Attack?

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack where an attacker floods a network, server, or application with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. When multiple compromised systems are used, it becomes a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

---

### 2.2 How a DoS Attack Works

- The attacker sends a massive number of requests to a target server.
- The server exhausts its bandwidth, memory, or CPU resources.
- Legitimate users are unable to access the service.
- In DDoS attacks, botnets (networks of infected devices) amplify the attack.

---

### 2.3 Impact of DoS Attacks

- Website or service downtime  
- Financial losses due to service unavailability  
- Damage to brand reputation  
- Loss of customer trust  
- Operational disruption  

---

### 2.4 Real-World Example

**GitHub DDoS Attack (2018)**  
GitHub faced one of the largest DDoS attacks, peaking at 1.35 Tbps. Attackers used memcached servers to amplify traffic, temporarily disrupting GitHub services.

---

### 2.5 Prevention and Mitigation

- Implement DDoS protection services (Cloudflare, AWS Shield)  
- Use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)  
- Traffic filtering and rate limiting  
- Load balancing  
- Regular network monitoring  

---

## 3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

### 3.1 What is a MITM Attack?

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

---

### 3.2 How a MITM Attack Works

- The attacker positions themselves between the user and the server.
- Communication is intercepted without the victim’s knowledge.
- Sensitive data such as login credentials, banking details, or messages can be stolen or modified.
- Common in unsecured Wi-Fi networks.

---

### 3.3 Impact of MITM Attacks

- Data theft (passwords, financial data)
- Identity theft
- Unauthorized account access
- Financial fraud
- Loss of confidentiality and integrity

---

### 3.4 Real-World Example

**Public Wi-Fi Attacks**  
Attackers set up fake Wi-Fi hotspots in cafes or airports. Users unknowingly connect and attackers intercept sensitive information like emails and banking credentials.

---

### 3.5 Prevention and Mitigation

- Use HTTPS and SSL/TLS encryption  
- Avoid unsecured public Wi-Fi networks  
- Use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)  
- Regularly update software and security patches  

---

## 4. Spoofing Attacks

### 4.1 What is Spoofing?

Spoofing is a cyberattack where an attacker disguises themselves as a trusted entity to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or spread malware. Types include IP spoofing, email spoofing, ARP spoofing, and DNS spoofing.

---

### 4.2 How Spoofing Attacks Work

- The attacker falsifies identity information.
- Victims believe the communication is from a legitimate source.
- Attackers exploit trust to steal data or redirect traffic.
- Often used as a precursor to larger attacks.

---

### 4.3 Impact of Spoofing Attacks

- Unauthorized access to systems  
- Phishing and financial fraud  
- Malware distribution  
- Network disruptions  
- Compromised data integrity  

---

### 4.4 Real-World Example

**Email Spoofing in Phishing Attacks**  
Attackers send emails appearing to be from banks or companies like PayPal, tricking users into revealing login credentials or clicking malicious links.

---

### 4.5 Prevention and Mitigation

- Implement email security protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
- Use authentication mechanisms  
- Network monitoring and ARP inspection  
- DNS security extensions (DNSSEC)  
- User awareness and training  

---

## 5. Comparative Overview of Threats

| Threat Type | Main Objective | Common Target | Key Risk |
|------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| DoS/DDoS | Disrupt services | Servers, websites | Downtime |
| MITM | Steal or alter data | Users, networks | Data breach |
| Spoofing | Impersonation | Users, systems | Fraud |

---

## 6. Conclusion

Network security threats such as DoS attacks, MITM attacks, and spoofing pose serious risks to modern digital infrastructures. These attacks can cause financial loss, reputational damage, and data compromise. Understanding how these threats work and implementing strong preventive measures such as encryption, authentication, firewalls, and user awareness is essential for maintaining secure networks. Proactive security strategies and continuous monitoring play a crucial role in defending against evolving cyber threats.
